# Linear Discriminant Analysis with Jacknifed Prediction
# The code above performs an LDA, using listwise deletion 
# of missing data. CV=TRUE generates jacknifed (i.e., leave 
# one out) predictions. The code below assesses the accuracy 
# of the prediction.
fit <- lda(factor(category) ~ v1 + v2 + v3 + v4 + v5 + v6 + v7 + v8 + v9 + v10, 
           data=df, 
           na.action="na.omit", 
           CV=TRUE)
fit        # show results

plot(fit) # fit from lda

# Assess the accuracy of the prediction
# percent correct for each category of G
ct <- table(df$category, fit$class)
diag(prop.table(ct, 1))
# total percent correct
sum(diag(prop.table(ct)))

# lda() prints discriminant functions based on centered (not standardized) 
# variables. The "proportion of trace" that is printed is the proportion of 
# between-class variance that is explained by successive discriminant functions. 
# No significance tests are produced. Refer to the section on MANOVA for 
# such tests.

# Quadratic discriminant function does not assume homogeneity of
# variance-covariance matrices.
