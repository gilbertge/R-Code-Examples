library(plyr)
rename(d, c("OLDVARNAME"="NEWVARNAME", ...))


## Use the following code to rename more than one column in a data frame
colnames(df) <- c("col1","col2", ...)

# Rename column by name: change "beta" to "two"
names(d)[names(d)=="beta"] <- "two"

# You can also rename by position, but this is a bit dangerous if your data
# can change in the future. If there is a change in the number or positions of
# columns, then this can result in wrong data.

# Rename by index in names vector: change third item, "gamma", to "three"
names(d)[3] <- "three"
