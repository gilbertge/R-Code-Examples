## To merge two data frames (datasets) horizontally, use the merge function. 
##    In most cases, you join two data frames by one or more common key 
##    variables (i.e., an inner join).
##
## Merge two data frames by ID
total <- merge(data frameA,data frameB,by="ID")

## Merge two data frames by ID and Country
total <- merge(data frameA,data frameB,by=c("ID","Country"))
