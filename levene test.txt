## Test homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices using Levene's test
## Levene's test is an alternative to the Bartlett test. The Levene test is less sensitive than 
##    the Bartlett test to departures from normality. If you have strong evidence that your data 
##    do in fact come from a normal, or nearly normal, distribution, then Bartlett's test has 
##    better performance.
## Levene's test is used to investigate where heterogenity of variance exists, what variable
