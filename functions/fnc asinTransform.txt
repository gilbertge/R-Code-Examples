## The arcsine transformation  (also called the arcsine square root transformation, 
## or the angular transformation) is used for percentage data. In some cases, the 
## result is not multiplied by two (Sokal and Rohlf 1995). Multiplying by two makes
## the arcsine scale go from zero to pi; not multiplying by two makes the scale stop 
## at pi/2.  The choice is arbitrary.
