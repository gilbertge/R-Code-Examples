## This function is a part of the R package "comorbidities"; however
##    "comorbidities" is not available under R 3.2.1
##
## This function take as input a data frame structured such that each 
##    row contains a list of ICD-9-CM codes attributed to a single patient. 
##    The function goes from row to row comparing the ICD-9-CM codes a patient 
##    has with the Elixhauser comorbidity index diagnosis codes. If a patient 
##    has a diagnosis (as indicated by ICD-9-CM code) that belongs to one of 
##    the Elixhauser diagnoses, then the patient is considered to have this 
##    diagnosis. Regardless of how many different ICD-9-CM codes a patient 
##    has corresponding to a particular comorbidity category, a comorbidity 
##    is only counted once.
##
## The value returned consists of a vector and a data frames. The vector 
##    is the total comorbidity count. In the data frame returned each row in 
##    the data frame is devoted to a particular patient, and each column is 
##    a diagnosis. The data frame codes a 0 if the patient does not have 
##    that diagnosis and 1 if the patient does have that diagnosis.
