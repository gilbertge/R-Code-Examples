## For FINAL.PASSAGE quasi-separation or complete separation exists.
## A discussion of separation can be seen here: 
## http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/11109/how-to-deal-with-perfect-separation-in-logistic-regression
## 
## One of the best and most thorough explanations of "quasi-complete 
## separation" issues in maximum likelihood is Paul Allison's paper. 
## He's writing about SAS software, but the issues he addresses are 
## generalizable to any software:
## 
## Complete separation occurs whenever a linear function of x can 
## generate perfect predictions of y
##
## Quasi-complete separation occurs when (a) there exists some coefficient 
## vector b such that bxi ≥ 0 whenever yi = 1, and bxi ≤ 0* whenever **yi = 0 
## and this equality holds for at least one case in each category of the 
## dependent variable. In other words in the simplest case, for any dichotomous 
## independent variable in a logistic regression, if there is a zero in the 2×2 
## table formed by that variable and the dependent variable, the ML estimate for 
## the regression coefficient does not exist.

## To address this problem, we will use Bayesian regression.

## Bayesian analysis with non-informative prior assumptions as proposed by 
## Gelman et al (2008). As Scortchi mentions, Gelman recommends to put a Cauchy 
## prior with median 0.0 and scale 2.5 on each coefficient (normalized to have 
## mean 0.0 and a SD of 0.5). This will regularize the coefficients and pull 
## them just slightly towards zero. In this case it is exactly what you want. 
## Due to having very wide tails the Cauchy still allows for large coefficients 
## (as opposed to the short tailed Normal)
