## Do univariate regression
##    Reference: http://www.statmethods.net/stats/anova.html
aov.mfd <- aov(mfd ~ factor(group), data=df)
summary(aov.mfd)

## Evaluate Model Effects
## R provides Type I sequential SS, not the default Type III marginal SS reported 
##    by SAS and SPSS. In a nonorthogonal design with more than one term on the 
##    right hand side of the equation order will matter (i.e., A+B and B+A will 
##    produce different results)! We will need use the drop1( ) function to produce 
##    the familiar Type III results. It will compare each term with the full model. 
##    Alternatively, we can use anova(fit.model1, fit.model2) to compare nested 
##    models directly.
drop1(aov.mfd,~.,test="F") # type III SS and F Tests

## Multiple Comparisons
## You can get Tukey HSD tests using the function below. By default, it calculates 
##    post hoc comparisons on each factor in the model. You can specify specific 
##    factors as an option. Again, remember that results are based on Type I SS!
