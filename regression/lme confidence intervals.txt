## Approximate CIs for glmer object
(coeftbl <- as.data.frame(coef(summary(cd.final))))
## Confidence intervals are exponentiated
exp(with(coeftbl,
     Estimate + outer(`Std. Error`, c(lower=-1, upper=1)) * sqrt(qchisq(0.95, 1))))

## Calculate the relative risk of the independent variables. This cannot be done in ond step because 
##    estimates of for the random effects are included in the confidence intervals. 
## Calculate confidence intervals for effects
##    We can also see that .sig01, which is our estimate of the variability in the random effects, 
##    isn't very large and is well defined. This indicates we do not have a lack of precision between our
##    groups - if we did this could be due to the effect being small between groups, we have too few groups to get a 
##    more precise estimate, we have too few units within each group, or a combination of all of the above.
