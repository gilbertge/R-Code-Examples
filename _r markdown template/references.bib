abstract = {It is a professional and social duty to promote diversity within academe. Presently, racial and ethnic representations of veterinary minority students are in great disproportion compared to the United States (US) census data. The Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC) has placed great emphasis in developing diversity centers of excellence, as well as having introduced climate surveys to assess level of comfort surrounding diversity within American Veterinary Medical Association's (AVMA) Council on Education (COE) accredited colleges. Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine (RUSVM) was the first international AVMA accredited institution participating in the second climate survey conducted across US veterinary schools and colleges. All RUSVM students, faculty and support staff (n=1448) were invited to complete an adapted form of the climate survey online. The survey response rate was 36{\%}. Study results showed the majority of students and faculty self-identified as White (80{\%} and 76{\%}, respectively) and the majority of support staff self-identified as African American or Black (71{\%}). Forty-four percent of faculty reported a legal residence of Europe, Asia, Africa, or the Caribbean. Non-US students, most often indicated Canadian residency. The most common country of residency reported by supporting staff was Saint Kitts and Nevis (68{\%}). Diversity within the context of the university's geographical location offers a unique opportunity in gaining an understanding of a different culture and how cultural perspectives influence veterinary care, though equally sudden immersion in a new culture can challenge individual and cultural norms as well as raise issues surrounding privileges and perceived advantages and disadvantages.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although emerging evidence during the past several decades suggests that psychosocial factors can directly influence both physiologic function and health outcomes, medicine had failed to move beyond the biomedical model, in part because of lack of exposure to the evidence base supporting the biopsychosocial model. The literature was reviewed to examine the efficacy of representative psychosocial-mind-body interventions, including relaxation, (cognitive) behavioral therapies, meditation, imagery, biofeedback, and hypnosis for several common clinical conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: An electronic search was undertaken of the MEDLINE, PsycLIT, and the Cochrane Library databases and a manual search of the reference sections of relevant articles for related clinical trials and reviews of the literature. Studies examining mind-body interventions for psychological disorders were excluded. Owing to space limitations, studies examining more body-based therapies, such as yoga and tai chi chuan, were also not included. Data were extracted from relevant systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Drawing principally from systematic reviews and meta-analyses, there is considerable evidence of efficacy for several mind-body therapies in the treatment of coronary artery disease (eg, cardiac rehabilitation), headaches, insomnia, incontinence, chronic low back pain, disease and treatment-related symptoms of cancer, and improving postsurgical outcomes. We found moderate evidence of efficacy for mind-body therapies in the areas of hypertension and arthritis. Additional research is required to clarify the relative efficacy of different mind-body therapies, factors (such as specific patient characteristics) that might predict more or less successful outcomes, and mechanisms of action. Research is also necessary to examine the cost offsets associated with mind-body therapies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: There is now considerable evidence that an array of mind-body therapies can be used as effective adjuncts to conventional medical treatment for a number of common clinical conditions.},

abstract = {Veterinary surgeons are known to be at a higher risk of suicide compared with the general population. There has been much speculation regarding possible mechanisms underlying the increased suicide risk in the profession, but little empirical research. A computerised search of published literature on the suicide risk and influences on suicide among veterinarians, with comparison to the risk and influences in other occupational groups and in the general population, was used to develop a structured review. Veterinary surgeons have a proportional mortality ratio (PMR) for suicide approximately four times that of the general population and around twice that of other healthcare professions. A complex interaction of possible mechanisms may occur across the course of a veterinary career to increase the risk of suicide. Possible factors include the characteristics of individuals entering the profession, negative effects during undergraduate training, work-related stressors, ready access to and knowledge of means, stigma associated with mental illness, professional and social isolation, and alcohol or drug misuse (mainly prescription drugs to which the profession has ready access). Contextual effects such as attitudes to death and euthanasia, formed through the profession's routine involvement with euthanasia of companion animals and slaughter of farm animals, and suicide 'contagion' due to direct or indirect exposure to suicide of peers within this small profession are other possible influences.},

abstract = {The present study evaluated the impact of academic and non-academic stressors on depression levels in a longitudinal investigation of 78 first-year veterinary medical students enrolled at Kansas State University (KSU). Students completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale during their first and second semesters to evaluate the dependent variable, depression. Students provided information about specific stressors and relevant demographic variables that yielded independent variables. One-third of veterinary medical students surveyed in their first and second semesters reported depression levels above the clinical cut-off; 15{\%} of the sample experienced an increase in depression of at least one standard deviation, despite the apparent stability of the proportion of students experiencing significant depressive symptoms. Students whose depression scores increased by one standard deviation or who maintained scores above the clinical cut-off score were identified as struggling. Struggling students reported more first-semester homesickness and academic concerns, along with difficulty fitting in with peers and poorer perceived physical health during the second semester. This study helped to identify those students most prone to develop or maintain concerning depression scores. The discussion section addresses specific suggestions for intervening with struggling students.},

Multivariate models with general covariance structure are often difficult to apply to highly unbalanced data, whereas two-stage random-effects models can be used easily. In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed. Two examples are taken from a current epidemiological study of the health effects of air pollution.},

abstract = {This study builds on previous research on predictors of depression and anxiety in veterinary medical students and reports data on three veterinary cohorts from two universities through their first three semesters of study. Across all three semesters, 49{\%}, 65{\%}, and 69{\%} of the participants reported depression levels at or above the clinical cut-off, suggesting a remarkably high percentage of students experiencing significant levels of depression symptoms. Further, this study investigated the relationship between common stressors experienced by veterinary students and mental health, general health, and academic performance. A factor analysis revealed four factors among stressors common to veterinary students: academic stress, transitional stress, family-health stress, and relationship stress. The results indicated that both academic stress and transitional stress had a robust impact on veterinary medical students' well-being during their first three semesters of study. As well, academic stress negatively impacted students in the areas of depression and anxiety symptoms, life satisfaction, general health, perception of academic performance, and grade point average (GPA). Transitional stress predicted increased depression and anxiety symptoms and decreased life satisfaction. This study helped to further illuminate the magnitude of the problem of depression and anxiety symptoms in veterinary medical students and identified factors most predictive of poor outcomes in the areas of mental health, general health, and academic performance. The discussion provides recommendations for considering structural changes to veterinary educational curricula to reduce the magnitude of academic stressors. Concurrently, recommendations are suggested for mental health interventions to help increase students' resistance to environmental stressors.},

@article{Welke2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Simulation experience alone without debriefing is insufficient for learning. Standardized multimedia instruction has been shown to be useful in teaching surgical skills but has not been evaluated for use as an adjunct in crisis management training. Our primary purpose in this study was to determine whether standardized computer-based multimedia instruction is effective for learning, and whether the learning is retained 5 wk later. Our secondary purpose was to compare multimedia instruction to personalized video-assisted oral debriefing with an expert. METHODS: Thirty anesthesia residents were recruited to manage three different simulated resuscitation scenarios using a high-fidelity patient simulator. After the first scenario, subjects were randomized to either a computer-based multimedia tutorial or a personal debriefing of their performance with an expert and videotape review. After their respective teaching, subjects managed a similar posttest resuscitation scenario and a third retention test scenario 5 wk later. Performances were independently rated by two blinded expert assessors using a previously validated assessment system. RESULTS: Posttest (12.22 +/- 2.19, P = 0.009) and retention (12.80 +/- 1.77, P {\textless} 0.001) performances of nontechnical skills were significantly improved in the standardized multimedia instruction group compared with pretest (10.27 +/- 2.10). There were no significant differences in improvement between the two methods of instruction. CONCLUSION: Computer-based multimedia instruction is an effective method of teaching nontechnical skills in simulated crisis scenarios and may be as effective as personalized oral debriefing. Multimedia may be a valuable adjunct to centers when debriefing expertise is not available.},

abstract = {Students in veterinary schools can experience stress in balancing the different demands on them-academic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and professional or work related-as well as managing potential conflict between animal and human interests. Practicing veterinarians report many similar stressors and reactions. Stressful stimuli produce stress reactions that can be inimical to physical and psychological well-being, and students' performance in veterinary programs can be adversely affected if they do not have coping resources. While there has been some research into stress among university students in general, and among medical students in particular, there is little on the experience of veterinary students. This article describes a study by the School of Psychology, commissioned by the Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, at Murdoch University in Western Australia. It was designed to investigate the levels and causes of stress among, and the frequency and type of coping strategies used by, fourth- and fifth-year students. Results indicate that the students in this cohort faced frequent stressors and felt at least moderately stressed but did not routinely and systematically use a range of coping strategies. Academic stressors and perceived responsibilities attached to moving into practical or professional areas figured strongly and were associated with higher levels of stress in the students, in particular physical sequelae. Though the numbers were small, it is of concern that some students were using measures that were potentially harmful. Some recommendations are made here about measures that veterinary programs may be able to incorporate to address stress in their students. Information is included on current strategies within the curriculum to manage potential stressful situations as part of students' professional development.},

abstract = {Introduction : Empathy among medical practitioners has been shown to affect patient care and outcomes. Factors such as stress and depression are known to have a negative impact on medical student empathy. Approaches such as mindfulness, meditation, and other mind–body techniques can enhance empathy and reverse burnout symptoms. In the present study, we evaluated impact of Mind Body Medicine (MBM) course on perceived stress and empathy on first-year medical students. Methods : Thirteen first-year medical students in total self-selected into MBM (experimental) and seven non-MBM (control) groups completed a prospective, pre- and post-test analysis, using the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy – Students (JSPE-S), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Personal Health Questionnaire (PHQ) to evaluate empathy, stress, and depression, respectively. Results : Our results showed an increase in stress, as well as a decrease in empathy, in both MBM and non-MBM groups throughout the course of the study. Conclusion : Our study demonstrated that the inverse relationship increased stress and decreased empathy among first-year medical students and participation in the MBM course did not attenuate the changes. However, a statistically significant rise in the depression score in the non-MBM group was not observed in the MBM group.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent research has revealed concerning rates of anxiety and depression among university students. Nevertheless, only a small percentage of these students receive treatment from university health services. Universities are thus challenged with instituting preventative programs that address student stress and reduce resultant anxiety and depression. METHOD: A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing stress in university students. Studies were eligible for inclusion if the assignment of study participants to experimental or control groups was by random allocation or parallel cohort design. RESULTS: Retrieved studies represented a variety of intervention approaches with students in a broad range of programs and disciplines. Twenty-four studies, involving 1431 students were included in the meta-analysis. Cognitive, behavioral and mindfulness interventions were associated with decreased symptoms of anxiety. Secondary outcomes included lower levels of depression and cortisol. LIMITATIONS: Included studies were limited to those published in peer reviewed journals. These studies over-represent interventions with female students in Western countries. Studies on some types of interventions such as psycho-educational and arts based interventions did not have sufficient data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: This review provides evidence that cognitive, behavioral, and mindfulness interventions are effective in reducing stress in university students. Universities are encouraged to make such programs widely available to students. In addition however, future work should focus on developing stress reduction programs that attract male students and address their needs.},
